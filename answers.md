# Assignment Questions & Answers

## Technical Implementation Questions

### Q1: Why did you choose React Native with Expo for this project?

**Answer**: I chose React Native with Expo because:

1. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Write once, run on both iOS and Android
2. **Rapid development**: Expo provides excellent development tools and faster iteration cycles
3. **Rich ecosystem**: Access to native device features without complex native code
4. **Easy deployment**: Expo makes building and distributing apps straightforward
5. **Priority consideration**: The assignment specifically mentioned React Native would be given more priority
6. **Learning curve**: React Native has excellent documentation and community support

### Q2: How did you implement data persistence in the app?

**Answer**: I implemented data persistence using AsyncStorage:

- **Local Storage**: All guest data is stored locally on the device using AsyncStorage
- **Automatic Saving**: Data is automatically saved whenever the guests array changes using useEffect
- **Data Loading**: Guest data is loaded when the app starts
- **JSON Format**: Data is stored as JSON strings and parsed when retrieved
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for storage operations

```javascript
const saveGuests = async () => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(guests));
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to save guests');
  }
};
```

### Q3: How did you handle API integration and error scenarios?

**Answer**: API integration was implemented with robust error handling:

1. **API Choice**: Used RandomUser.me API for generating random guest names
2. **Loading States**: Added loading indicators during API calls
3. **Network Error Handling**: Catch and display user-friendly error messages
4. **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
5. **User Feedback**: Clear success and error messages using Alert dialogs

```javascript
const addRandomGuest = async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/');
    const data = await response.json();
    // Handle success...
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to fetch random guest. Please check your internet connection.');
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### Q4: What design patterns and best practices did you follow?

**Answer**: I implemented several best practices:

1. **Component Structure**: Single-component architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **State Management**: Used React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management
3. **Code Organization**: Logical grouping of functions and clear naming conventions
4. **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive UI with clear visual feedback and confirmations
6. **Performance**: Efficient list rendering with FlatList and key extraction
7. **Accessibility**: Proper button labeling and touch target sizes

### Q5: How did you implement the search and filter functionality?

**Answer**: I created a combined search and filter system:

1. **Real-time Search**: Search updates as user types, filtering by guest name
2. **Status Filtering**: Filter guests by RSVP status (All/Yes/No/Maybe)
3. **Combined Filtering**: Search and status filters work together
4. **Case-insensitive**: Search is case-insensitive for better user experience
5. **Performance**: Efficient filtering using JavaScript array methods

```javascript
const getFilteredGuests = () => {
  let filtered = guests;
  
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(guest =>
      guest.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
    );
  }
  
  if (filterStatus !== 'All') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(guest => guest.rsvp === filterStatus);
  }
  
  return filtered;
};
```

## User Experience Questions

### Q6: How did you ensure good user experience?

**Answer**: UX was prioritized through:

1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear visual hierarchy and easy-to-understand interface
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Loading states, success messages, and error alerts
3. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletions with confirmation prompts
4. **Visual Statistics**: Dashboard showing guest counts and RSVP breakdown
5. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes
6. **Color Coding**: Different colors for RSVP statuses for quick visual identification
7. **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no guests are present

### Q7: What accessibility considerations were implemented?

**Answer**: Accessibility features include:

1. **Touch Targets**: Adequate button sizes for easy tapping
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear typography and spacing
3. **Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast for readability
4. **Semantic Elements**: Proper use of TouchableOpacity for interactive elements
5. **Error Messages**: Clear, descriptive error messages
6. **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback for loading states

## Project Management Questions

### Q8: How did you structure your development process?

**Answer**: I followed a systematic approach:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Carefully read and understood all requirements
2. **Technology Selection**: Chose appropriate tech stack (React Native + Expo)
3. **Feature Prioritization**: Implemented core features first, then bonus features
4. **Iterative Development**: Built features incrementally with testing
5. **Code Quality**: Focused on clean, maintainable code with proper commenting
6. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive README and this answers file

### Q9: What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?

**Answer**: Key challenges and solutions:

1. **State Management**: Managed complex state with multiple useState hooks and useEffect for side effects
2. **Data Persistence**: Implemented AsyncStorage with proper error handling
3. **API Integration**: Added robust error handling and loading states for API calls
4. **UI/UX Design**: Created an intuitive interface with proper visual feedback
5. **Search Performance**: Optimized search with efficient filtering algorithms
6. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Used Expo to ensure consistent behavior across platforms

### Q10: How would you scale this application?

**Answer**: For scaling, I would consider:

1. **State Management**: Implement Redux or Context API for complex state
2. **Backend Integration**: Add a proper backend with user authentication
3. **Database**: Use a cloud database like Firebase or AWS DynamoDB
4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live updates
5. **Push Notifications**: Add notifications for RSVP reminders
6. **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests
7. **Performance**: Add code splitting and lazy loading for better performance
8. **Analytics**: Integrate analytics to track user behavior and app performance

## Technical Depth Questions

### Q11: Explain your component architecture decisions.

**Answer**: I chose a single-component architecture for this project because:

1. **Simplicity**: The app is relatively small and doesn't require complex component hierarchy
2. **Rapid Development**: Single component allows for faster development and easier debugging
3. **State Management**: All related state is in one place, making it easier to manage
4. **Future Refactoring**: Easy to break into smaller components when the app grows

For a larger application, I would break this into:
- `GuestList` component
- `GuestCard` component
- `AddGuestModal` component
- `SearchFilter` component
- `StatsDisplay` component

### Q12: How did you ensure code quality and maintainability?

**Answer**: Code quality measures include:

1. **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
2. **Function Separation**: Each function has a single responsibility
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the app
4. **Comments**: Added comments for complex logic
5. **Code Structure**: Logical organization of code sections
6. **Styling**: Organized StyleSheet with descriptive style names
7. **Constants**: Used constants for storage keys and repeated values
